Social Network Analysis (short course)

This course will introduce students to social network analytics (SNA) and their instrumental value for businesses and the society. SNA encompasses techniques and methods for analyzing the constant flow of information over online social networks (e.g. Facebook posts, twitter feeds, foursquare check-ins) aiming to identify, sometimes even in real-time, patterns of information propagation that are of interest to the analyst. The course will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the opportunities, challenges and threats arising by online social media as far as businesses and the society at large are concerned. It will use case-based teaching and discussions to introduce students to the social and ethical issues that often arise by mining the publicly available information across online social networks for business purposes and/or other types of analyses. Finally, students will be introduced to the concepts of the wisdom of the crowds and social learning, investigating the conditions under which opinion convergence (asymptotic learning) or herding may occur in online social networks.
